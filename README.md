# Real Estate Backend Application

This is the backend application for a real estate platform built using ASP.NET Core. The app provides APIs for property listings, user management, and other real estate functionalities.

## Features

- Property Listings CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- User Registration and Role Based as staff and novice user Authentication
- Search and Filter Properties
- Admin Dashboard for Property Management
- Secure User Authentication using JWT

## Prerequisites

Before you can clone and run this project, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (Community or higher version)
- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version 6.0 or higher)
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) (for database purposes, you can also use SQL Server Express)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) (for testing the API endpoints, optional)

## Clone the Repository

To clone the repository to your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Go to `File` > `Clone Repository`.
3. Enter the URL of the repository (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/real-estate-backend`).
4. Select a directory to clone the repository to.

Alternatively, you can clone it via the command line:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rebiya/backend-using-ASP.NET.git


Setting up the Project
Once you have cloned the repository, follow these steps to set up the project in Visual Studio:

1. Open the Project
Open Visual Studio and go to File > Open > Project/Solution.
Navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository and open the solution file (.sln).
2. Restore NuGet Packages
Visual Studio will automatically restore any missing NuGet packages upon opening the solution. If not, you can manually restore the packages using:

```bash
dotnet restore


3. Configure the Database
You need to set up a SQL Server database to store property listings and user data.

Open appsettings.json and update the ConnectionStrings section to point to your local or remote SQL Server database:

```bash
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=your-server-name;Database=RealEstateDb;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
}


Run the database migrations to create the required tables:

```dotnet ef database update

Ensure you have installed Entity Framework Core tools if you haven't yet.

4. Build the Project
To build the project, simply press Ctrl + Shift + B or go to Build > Build Solution.

5. Run the Application
Once the build is successful, you can run the application by pressing F5 or clicking on the Start button in Visual Studio. The backend API will be hosted locally by default (e.g., https://localhost:5001).

6. Test the API
You can use Postman or Swagger UI to test the available API endpoints.

Example API Endpoints:
GET /api/properties - Get a list of all properties
GET /api/properties/{id} - Get details of a specific property
POST /api/properties - Add a new property
PUT /api/properties/{id} - Update an existing property
DELETE /api/properties/{id} - Delete a property
Configuration and Customization
Modify the appsettings.json to configure different environments like Development, Staging, or Production.
Customize the controller logic, database models, and API routes to meet your real estate business requirements.


### How to Use This Readme:
1. **Clone** the repository using either Visual Studio or the Git command line.
2. **Configure the database** connection in the `appsettings.json` file.
3. **Restore dependencies** and run database migrations (if using Entity Framework).
4. **Build and Run** the solution to get the backend up and running.
5. **Use Postman/Swagger** to test API endpoints.
